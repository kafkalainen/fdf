# FDF

## Wireframing project for 42 curriculum at Hive Helsinki


### Features
- Scaling.
- Specify the color spectrum in parameter.
- Manage correctly the hidden surfaces.
- Change types of projection.


### Notes
- Middlepoint should be window's origo.
- Translation Figure slides in any direction.
- Reflection Figure flips over a line.
- Rotation Figure turns over a fixed point.
- Dilation Figure is enlarged or reduced.
  An isometry is a rigid transformation that preserves length and angle measures, as well as perimeter and area.
- X is right, z is outward and y is up.
- Vector's length is norm or magnitude.
- a Â· b = |a| * |b| * cos(a, b)
- Use static void function to create static variables to use in functions.


### Reasonings
- I use g42 prefix for project files that I deem usable in other projects and fdf to be project specific prefix.
- I created g42 struct coord to hold x, y, z coordinates as doubles.
- Struct map holds the coordinates for the points in the original map. However, image has a coordinates of it's own, where you need to change coordinates of the 3d (x,y,z) match 2d (x,y) plane. Point z has an equivalent in a 2d coordinate system, and that has to be found in order to create rotation and dilation.
- x, y, z could be 0,0,0 and other point could be 1, 0, 10, but in x, y axis, that could be x, y (0,0 and 0, 10 respectively) or even 20, 200, since pixels.
- Origo of the 2d plane is at 300, 400 pixels, or 200, 300 pixels.
- Vector's length in first rendering is 30 pixels move in coordinates.
- Screen space is set to left -1 right +1, +1 bottom and -1 up.
- Camera needs to have set coordinates, let's assume that is 0, 0, 0.
- To get isometric view of the object, set the Rotation order to zyx,
  the z Rotation to 45 and the y Rotation to 35.264.
- 3d space.
- Object coordinates to world coordinates.
- World coordinates to camera coordinates.
- Camera coordinates to ndc.
- NDC to raster space.
- WDC (Window)
- NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates)
- PDC (Physical Device Coordinates)
- Create isdigit_base and ft_atoi_base.
- A valid map has depth coordinates in hexadecimal, combined (1,0xFF) or in decimal notation. It can have different row length.
- A valid map has only following characters
	`0123456789xXabcdefABCDEF,\s\n`

### To-do
- Read about vectors and matrices, and how to use them.
- If vectors and matrices fail, then use ready-made trigonometric solution.
- Test by creating a
- z depth/height
- x point
- y point
